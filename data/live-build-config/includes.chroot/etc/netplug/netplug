# interface into the "up" state, so that it can generate netlink(7) events.
# This interferes with "admin down" for an interface. Thus, commented out. An
# "admin up" is treated as a "link up" and thus, "link up" action is executed.
# To execute "link down" action on "admin down", run appropriate script in
# /etc/netplug/linkdown.d
